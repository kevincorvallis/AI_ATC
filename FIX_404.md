# 🔴 FIXING VERCEL 404 ERROR - STEP BY STEP

## The Problem

Vercel is showing a 404 error because it's still deploying the old file structure.

## The Solution (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Commit and Push (Run This Script)

```bash
./deploy-to-github.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment - move frontend to root"
git push origin main
```

**Wait 30-60 seconds for Vercel to auto-deploy.**

### Step 2: Check Vercel Project Settings

If still getting 404 after Step 1:

1. Go to **[Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)**
2. Click on your **AI_ATC** project
3. Go to **Settings** (top navigation)
4. Click **General** (left sidebar)
5. Scroll down to **Root Directory**
6. Make sure it shows: `./` or is **empty**
7. If it says `frontend`, change it to `./` or leave empty
8. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Force Redeploy

1. In your Vercel project, click **Deployments** tab
2. Click the **...** menu on the latest deployment
3. Click **Redeploy**
4. Wait 30-60 seconds

## Verify Your Local Files

Run this to make sure files are in the right place:

```bash
ls -la | grep -E "index.html|app.js|styles.css"
```

You should see:
```
-rw-r--r--  index.html
-rw-r--r--  app.js
-rw-r--r--  styles.css
-rw-r--r--  live-atc.js
-rw-r--r--  airports.js
-rw-r--r--  config.js
```

All in the ROOT directory (not in a frontend/ folder).

## Check Vercel Build Logs

1. Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Click **Deployments**
3. Click on the latest deployment
4. Look for errors in the logs

**Common Issues:**
- "No output directory" - This is OK for static sites
- "index.html not found" - Files aren't in root
- Build fails - Check for syntax errors

## Nuclear Option: Delete and Reimport

If nothing works:

1. **Vercel Dashboard** → Your Project → **Settings**
2. Scroll to bottom → **Delete Project**
3. Confirm deletion
4. Go back to Vercel Dashboard
5. Click **Add New...** → **Project**
6. Select your **AI_ATC** repo again
7. **Important Settings:**
   - Framework Preset: **Other**
   - Root Directory: **Leave empty or `./`**
   - Build Command: **Leave empty**
   - Output Directory: **Leave empty**
8. Click **Deploy**

## Test Locally First

Before deploying, test that it works locally:

```bash
# From AI_ATC root directory
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open browser to `http://localhost:8000`

**Should see:** Main menu with two options

If this works locally but not on Vercel, it's definitely a Vercel configuration issue.

## Checklist

- [ ] index.html is in root directory (not frontend/)
- [ ] All JS/CSS files are in root directory
- [ ] Files are committed to git
- [ ] Files are pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Vercel Root Directory is `./` or empty
- [ ] Waited at least 60 seconds for deployment
- [ ] Checked Vercel deployment logs for errors

## Still Not Working?

Check these URLs:

**Your deployed site:**
- https://[your-project].vercel.app

**Should NOT be:**
- https://[your-project].vercel.app/frontend/

If you have to go to /frontend/ to see it, then Vercel Root Directory is wrong.

## Quick Fix Commands

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're in the AI_ATC directory
pwd

# 2. Verify index.html is here
ls index.html

# 3. Commit and push everything
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel 404"
git push origin main

# 4. Wait 60 seconds, then check your site
```

## Get the Vercel CLI (Optional)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy manually
vercel --prod
```

This bypasses GitHub and deploys directly.
